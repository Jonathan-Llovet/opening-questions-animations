## About
Code for videos on the [Opening Questions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRQ5gGxixCkYamF5S3sU1hA) Youtube channel.

Opening Questions makes resources for people to learn and engage with computer science, programming, math and science (and how they have developed throughout history), language, and philosophy.

Resources for more information about the topic of a series can be found in a README in the folder containing the code for the series' animations. Videos about programming or computer science that discuss code will have separate repositories for that code, and links can similarly be found in the README of the video series' animation code.

## About Manim

The animations for Opening Questions are made with the manim math animation engine, which was originally made by Grant Sanderson for 3b1b. Many thanks to Grant for creating this powerful tool, sharing it with the world, and making videos that help us see what's wonderful about math.
